# Now we want to estimate what is cheaper? To mitigate emissions by passenger-kilometer-equivalent / ton-kilometer-equivalent using SAF or using CDR?
  # This means: we calculate how much GHG (CO2 + non-CO2) are emitted per pass-km-eq and per ton-km-eq
  # Then we can calculate how much it costs to do CDR to offset those emissions
  # And how much would it cost to produce SAF to not have those emissions to begin with

#Create x & y arrays
SAF_cost_Liter <- seq(0, 2.8, by = 0.2) #SAF cost in $/L (x axis)
CDR_cost_ton <- seq(0, 700, by = 50) #CDR cost in $/ton  (y axis)

#Define constants from equation
pass_SAF <- 0.04 #This is the amount of liters of biofuel per pass-km-eq
pass_CDR <- 0.16 #This are the emissions in kg that need to be offset if we burn the fuel needed for 1 pass-km-eq
